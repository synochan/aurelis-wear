# Aurelis Wear API

This is the backend API for the Aurelis Wear e-commerce platform built with Django REST Framework.

## Tech Stack

- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (Neon)
- JWT Authentication

## Local Development Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure your `.env` file is properly set up (see `.env.example` for required variables)

4. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Access the API at: http://localhost:8000/api/

## Migrating Data from SQLite to Neon PostgreSQL

If you have existing data in a SQLite database that you need to migrate to Neon:

1. Make sure your SQLite database file exists and contains your data
2. Configure your `.env` file with the Neon PostgreSQL connection string
3. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   python migrate_to_neon.py
   ```
4. Once migration is complete, you can safely delete the SQLite database file

## Deploying to Render

### Method 1: Manual Deployment

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: aurelis-wear-api
   - **Environment**: Python
   - **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn backend.wsgi:application`

4. Add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secure random string
   - `DEBUG`: false
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: `.onrender.com,aurelis-wear-api.onrender.com`
   - `PYTHON_VERSION`: 3.11.7
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: https://aurelis-wear.vercel.app

5. Deploy the service

### Method 2: Using render.yaml Blueprint

1. Make sure your repository has the `render.yaml` file (already included)
2. Go to the Render Dashboard â†’ "Blueprint" section
3. Click "New Blueprint Instance"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure environment variables as needed
6. Deploy the blueprint

### Important Files for Render Deployment

- `build.sh`: Script that Render runs during the build process
- `Procfile`: Tells Render how to run the application
- `render.yaml`: Blueprint configuration for deployment
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies Python version

### After Deployment

1. Verify the API is working by visiting: https://aurelis-wear-api.onrender.com/api/
2. Update your frontend to connect to the new API endpoint
3. Test the complete flow of your application

## API Documentation

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `/api/products/` - Product listing and details
- `/api/auth/` - Authentication endpoints (register, login, etc.)
- `/api/cart/` - Shopping cart management
- `/api/orders/` - Order processing and history
- `/api/payments/` - Payment processing (if using)

## Security Notes

- Ensure all sensitive information is stored in environment variables, not in code
- The PostgreSQL connection string includes your database password, keep it secure
- Review CORS settings to ensure only trusted origins can access your API
- Set DEBUG=False in production to avoid leaking sensitive information
