# Changes Summary - Removing Lovable References

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Lovable-Tagger from Vite Config
- Removed the import of `componentTagger` from "lovable-tagger"
- Removed the conditional usage of componentTagger in the plugins array
- Simplified the plugins configuration to only include React

### 2. Removed Lovable-Tagger from Package.json
- Removed the "lovable-tagger" dependency from devDependencies
- This will prevent the package from being installed during npm install

### 3. Enhanced Favicon Configuration in index.html
- Added a second favicon link with shortcut icon type for better browser compatibility
- Added a comment to ensure the favicon is loaded with priority
- This helps prevent third-party scripts from overriding the favicon

### 4. Updated Project Documentation
- Updated PROJECT_SUMMARY.md to include information about removing Lovable dependencies
- Added a section about recent changes to document the removal of Lovable-related code

## Benefits of These Changes

2. **Enhanced Branding**: Ensuring the correct favicon is displayed strengthens brand identity
3. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removing unused dependencies makes the codebase easier to maintain

## Next Steps

4. Consider adding additional favicon formats for better cross-browser support
