# Project Cleanup Summary

## Removed Directories
- `/api` - Redundant API directory not part of the main Django application
- `/orders` - Duplicate of functionality properly implemented in backend/orders
- `/temp_img` - Empty temporary directory
- `/node_modules` - Root-level node modules (not needed as each project has its own)
- `backend/frontend` - Empty directory
- `backend/backend/orders` - Redundant nested orders directory
- `frontend/temp` - Temporary directory with favicon instructions

## Removed Files
- `backend/sample_data.py.bak` - Backup file
- `backend/images.py` - Empty (0 byte) file
- `backend/backend/settings.py.bak` - Backup file
- `frontend/src/api/config.ts.bak` - Backup file
- `render.yaml` - Empty file at root level (proper config exists in backend/)
- `DEPLOY.md` - Empty file (proper deployment instructions in RENDER_DEPLOY.md)

## Cleaned Cache Files
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories in the backend
- Removed any `.pyc` compiled Python files

## Project Structure After Cleanup
The project now has a cleaner structure with:

```
/aurelis-wear-shop-forge
├── backend/            # Django backend application
├── frontend/           # React frontend application
├── .env                # Environment variables
├── package.json        # Root package for development scripts
├── package-lock.json   # Lock file for root dependencies
├── CHANGES_SUMMARY.md  # Summary of changes made to remove Lovable references
├── CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md  # This summary file
├── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md  # Overall project summary
├── README.md           # Main project documentation
├── RENDER_DEPLOY.md    # Deployment instructions for Render
└── vercel.json         # Vercel configuration for frontend deployment
```

## Benefits of Cleanup
1. **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminated duplicate and redundant files/directories
2. **Smaller Codebase**: Removed unnecessary files, reducing repository size
3. **Better Organization**: Clearer separation between backend and frontend
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to understand project structure
5. **Reduced Build Time**: Removed unnecessary files that might slow down builds

## Next Steps
1. Run the application to verify everything works correctly
2. Consider implementing a `.gitignore` file to prevent cache files from being committed
3. Review documentation to ensure it reflects the current project structure
